A computer network is a physical and software interconnection infrastructure connecting computers, which uses a set of common communication protocols over digital interconnections to share resources located on or provided by the network nodes. The interconnections between nodes are formed from a broad spectrum of telecommunication network technologies, based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in various network topologies.

The nodes of a computer network may be classified by many means as personal computers, servers, networking hardware, or general-purpose hosts. They are identified by hostnames and network addresses. Hostnames serve as memorable labels for the nodes. Network addresses serve for locating and identifying the nodes by communication protocols such as the Internet Protocol.
