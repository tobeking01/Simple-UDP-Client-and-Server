Submission
Create a README file that contains a complete listing/explanation of what files are present in the directory and the instructions to compile and run your code (e.g., give a command-line example to test your code with a sample file or random string). 
Upload your .c or .py files and your README file to your dropbox. Your source code file must contain your name and star-id, or it will not be graded.
Note that you are encouraged to submit a Makefile for your code. If you do not submit one, please make sure to include the instructions on how to compile your code in your README file.
Your code will be evaluated on one of the university's virtual lab machines based on the following evaluation rubric.
