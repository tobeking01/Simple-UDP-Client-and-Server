UDP ReadMe Server

README

This directory contains a Python script that implements a simple UDP server that calculates the checksum of messages received from clients and sends the timestamp of the received message back to the client.

The script takes one argument: the port number on which the server should listen.

To run the script, you can use the following command:

python server.py <port_number>

For example, to run the server on port 8000, you would use the following command:

python server.py 8000

The script will then listen for incoming messages on port 8000. When a message is received, the script will calculate the checksum of the message and send the timestamp of the received message back to the client.

The script requires the following Python libraries:

socket
sys
hashlib
datetime
You can install these libraries using the following command:

pip install socket sys hashlib datetime

Once you have installed the required libraries, you can run the script by following the instructions above.

To test the script, you can send a message to the server from another computer. For example, you could use the following command to send the message "hello" to the server:

echo "hello" | nc localhost 8000

If the checksum of the message matches the checksum calculated by the server, the server will send the timestamp of the received message back to the client.
