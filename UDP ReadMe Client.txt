UDP ReadMe Client

README

This directory contains a Python script that calculates the RTT (round-trip time) between a client and a server. 
The script takes three arguments: the server IP address, the server port number, and the message to be sent to the server.

The script first creates a UDP socket and then sends the message to the server. 
The script then waits for a reply from the server and calculates the RTT. 
The script then prints the RTT in milliseconds.

To run the script, you can use the following command:

python rtt.py <server_ip> <server_port> <message>

For example, to send the message "hello" to the server at 127.0.0.1 on port 8000, you would use the following command:

python rtt.py 127.0.0.1 8000 hello

The script also supports sending a file to the server. 
To do this, you would pass the filename of the file as the third argument to the script. 

For example, to send the file "myfile.txt" to the server, you would use the following command:

python rtt.py 127.0.0.1 8000 myfile.txt

The script will then calculate the RTT for the file and print the result.

The script requires the following Python libraries:

* socket
* sys
* hashlib
* time

You can install these libraries using the following command:

Use code with caution. Learn more
pip install socket sys hashlib time

Once you have installed the required libraries, you can run the script by following the instructions above.
