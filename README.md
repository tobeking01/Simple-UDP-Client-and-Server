# Simple-UDP-Client-and-Server
Write a simple UDP client and server program and a communication protocol using C or python3 in which the client will send a message or a file to the server. Then, the server will reply with the timestamp when it receives the message. The client needs to compute the round-trip-time (RTT) of the sent messages.
